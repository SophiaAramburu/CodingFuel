project 2

1. Deleted env.EXAMPLE
1. Refactored mini-project - renamed project model file (project table) to intervew table and replace funding_needed field with tokens_earned
1. Updated any project code references to interview
1. Updated models, public, seeds, utils, views files with new table
1. Updated handlebars files with new title and interview page
1. Project currently runs in CLI but throws a 500 internal server error in browser while mini-project runs fine. I'm thinking Session is the problem but no idea how to fix it.
